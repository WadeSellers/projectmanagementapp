**Most productivity tools want too much from you**

### Three Problems (Icon + Text)

**📧 Endless Signup Forms**
Email, password, verification... Why can't you just start working?

**🕵️ Privacy Invasion**
Your tasks and projects are personal. Why do they need to live on someone else's server?

**💰 Freemium Tricks**
"Start free!" then suddenly you need to upgrade to unlock basic features.

## FAQ Section

### Headline
**Questions? Answers.**

**Q: Do I really not need an account?**
A: Nope! Just open the app and start organizing. No email, no password, nothing. We designed it to be as frictionless as possible.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Everything is stored in your browser's local storage. It never leaves your device. This means perfect privacy but also means you can't access it from a different browser/device (yet - export/import coming soon!).

**Q: Will it always be free?**
A: Yes. Since we don't have server costs (everything runs in your browser), we can keep it free forever. We might add optional paid features in the future, but the core will always be free.

**Q: Can I use it for team collaboration?**
A: Not yet! Right now Vibe is designed for solo use. We're exploring privacy-respecting collaboration features for the future.

**Q: What if I want to switch devices?**
A: We're building export/import functionality so you can backup your boards and transfer them between devices. Coming soon!

**Q: What browsers does it work on?**
A: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - all modern browsers work great. Mobile browsers too!

**Q: Is my data really private?**
A: Absolutely. We don't have servers to store your data on. It's architecturally impossible for us to see your tasks. You don't even need to trust us - the code proves it.

**Q: What if I want to back up my data?**
A: Your browser's local storage is quite reliable, but we're adding export to JSON so you can keep backups. You can also check your data anytime in DevTools → Application → Local Storage.
