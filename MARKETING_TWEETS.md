### Wednesday Workflow
```
How I use Vibe Kanban for freelance projects 🧵

Column 1: "Inbox" - all new requests
Column 2: "This Week" - committed work
Column 3: "In Progress" - max 2 items
Column 4: "Review" - waiting on client
Column 5: "Done" - satisfaction

Simple. Visual. Effective.
```

```
3 columns that changed my productivity:

🔴 Today (3 tasks max)
🟡 This Week
🟢 This Month

Anything else goes in "Someday/Maybe"

Less overwhelm. More focus.

### Thursday Behind the Scenes
```
Why we chose local storage over a backend 🧵

1/ Most kanban users don't need real-time collaboration
2/ Server costs would force us to charge
3/ Your data privacy matters
4/ It's MUCH faster
5/ Works offline automatically

Tech tradeoffs are really user experience tradeoffs.
```

```
Design decision: Why pink and purple?

Most productivity tools use:
• Blue (corporate, cold)
• Gray (boring, lifeless)
• Green (task apps, repetitive)

We wanted something:
✨ Energizing
💜 Creative
🎨 Memorable

Productivity can be beautiful.
```

### Friday Feature Deep Dive
```
Feature Friday: Keyboard Navigation ⌨️

Vibe Kanban is fully keyboard accessible:

Tab → Navigate between cards
Enter → Open card details
Escape → Close modal
Arrow keys → Move cards
Ctrl+Enter → Quick save

No mouse required. Power users love it.

```

```
Feature Friday: Smart Persistence 💾

Vibe Kanban auto-saves every change to local storage:

• Edit a card → Saved instantly
• Drag a card → New position saved
• Add a column → Persisted
• Close your browser → Everything's still there

No "Save" button anxiety.
```
