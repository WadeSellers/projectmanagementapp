## Welcome Series

### Email 1: Welcome (Sent immediately upon signup)

**Subject:** Welcome to Vibe Kanban ✨

**Preview Text:** Your beautiful project management journey starts now

**Body:**

Hi there!

Thanks for your interest in Vibe Kanban - the most beautiful way to organize your projects.

We're building something different. While other tools trap your data behind accounts and paywalls, we believe in a simpler approach:

✨ **No account needed** - Just open and start
🔒 **Your data stays yours** - Everything's stored locally in your browser
🎨 **Beautiful by design** - Productivity doesn't have to be boring
💸 **Free, forever** - No tricks, no upgrades, no gotchas

**Ready to get started?**

[Start Organizing Now →]

Here are three quick tips to make the most of Vibe Kanban:

1. **Start simple** - Begin with 3-4 columns (like "To Do," "Doing," "Done")
2. **Limit work in progress** - Keep your "Doing" column to 3 tasks max
3. **Use the notes** - Click any card to add detailed notes and context

Questions? Just reply to this email. We read every message.

Happy organizing,
The Vibe Kanban Team

P.S. No more emails unless you want them. We respect your inbox.

**Subject:** 5 features you might have missed ⚡️

**Preview Text:** Get more done with these hidden gems

**Body:**

Hey!

Hope you're enjoying Vibe Kanban! We noticed you've created your first few cards (nice work 🎉).

You might have missed these time-saving features:

**1. Double-click to rename columns** ✏️
No need to hunt for an edit button. Just double-click any column title.

**2. Keyboard shortcuts** ⌨️
- Ctrl+Enter to save card edits quickly
- Tab to navigate
- Enter to select
- Escape to cancel

**3. Drag handles on mobile** 📱
Long-press any card to start dragging on touch devices. Butter smooth.

**4. Everything auto-saves** 💾
No "Save" button anxiety. Every change is instantly saved to your browser.

**5. Works offline** ✈️
Since everything is local, Vibe works perfectly without internet. Take it on the plane!

**Want to level up your workflow?**

Try organizing one of these:
- Your side projects
- Freelance client work

The visual layout makes it click differently than a plain to-do list.

### Email 3: Privacy & Philosophy (Day 7)

**Subject:** Why we built Vibe Kanban differently 💜

**Preview Text:** A note about privacy, data, and our philosophy

**Body:**

Hi friend,

A week ago you signed up for Vibe Kanban updates. Today I want to share why we built this tool the way we did.

**The Problem**

Every productivity tool today wants to:
- Collect your email
- Store your data on their servers
- Track your behavior
- Eventually charge you

We kept asking: "Does it have to be this way?"

**Our Philosophy**

Your tasks, projects, and notes are deeply personal. You shouldn't need to trust a company with that data.

So we made Vibe Kanban local-first:
- **No servers** - Your data never leaves your browser
- **No tracking** - We literally can't see what you're organizing
- **No accounts** - Nothing to hack or breach
- **No costs** - No server costs means we can stay free forever

**The Tradeoff**

This approach means no real-time team collaboration (yet). But we learned that 80% of kanban users work solo anyway.

And the benefits? Instant performance, perfect privacy, and zero anxiety about data breaches.

**What's Next**

We're working on:
- Export/import (so you can backup or switch devices)
- Tags and labels
- Multiple boards
- Search and filter

All while keeping the same privacy-first approach.

**How You Can Help**

1. Share Vibe with one person who'd appreciate the privacy angle
2. Star us on GitHub [if open source - link]
3. Reply with your biggest feature request

Thanks for believing in a better way to build productivity tools.

Keep it organized,
[Founder Name]
Vibe Kanban

P.S. This is my last email unless you opt in for monthly updates below.

[No thanks, I'll just use the tool →]

## Feature Announcement Emails

### Email: New Feature - Export/Import

**Subject:** Export your boards (finally!) 📦

**Preview Text:** Backup, share, and move your data anywhere

**Body:**

Great news!

The most requested feature is here: **Export & Import**

- Backup all your boards
- Transfer between devices
- Keep archives of completed projects

📥 **Import from JSON**

Now you can.

### Email: New Feature - Multiple Boards

**Subject:** Multiple boards are here! 🎨

**Preview Text:** Separate your work, projects, and personal life

**Body:**

You asked, we built it!

**Multiple Boards** are now live in Vibe Kanban ✨

**Create unlimited boards for:**
- 💼 Work projects
- 🎨 Personal creative work
- 🏠 Home & life admin
- 📚 Learning & courses
- 💡 Side projects
- Anything you want to keep separate

**How it works:**

1. Click "My Boards" in the top left
2. Create a new board
3. Name it whatever you want
4. Switch between boards instantly

Everything still stays local. Everything's still private. Everything's still free.

**Pro tip from power users:**

Create boards for different "contexts":
- Deep Work (3-hour focus sessions)
- Quick Wins (tasks under 30 min)
- Waiting On (things you delegated)
- Someday/Maybe (future ideas)

The visual separation helps your brain switch modes.

What board will you create first?

Happy organizing,

## Seasonal/Promotional Emails

### New Year Email

**Subject:** New year, fresh start ✨

**Preview Text:** Organize 2025 your way

**Body:**

Happy New Year!

New year = new goals. But most of them fail by February.

Why? Usually because:
- Too many goals at once
- No clear next steps
- Lost track and gave up

**Here's a different approach:**

Use Vibe Kanban to create a "2025 Vision Board"

**Columns:**
1. **Dreams** - Everything you might want
2. **Q1 Focus** - Top 3 priorities this quarter
3. **In Progress** - What you're actively doing (max 2!)
4. **Done** - Celebrate what you've finished

Move cards between columns as the year progresses.

**Why this works:**

- Visual progress tracking
- Forces prioritization (can't do everything at once)
- Flexible (adjust as you learn)
- Satisfying (watching "Done" grow is motivating)

[Set Up Your 2025 Board →]

Here's to an organized, intentional, accomplished 2025.

You've got this 💜

## Email Best Practices

### Subject Line Testing
- Keep under 50 characters
- Use emoji sparingly (1 max)
- Ask questions
- Create curiosity
- State clear benefit

### Preview Text
- Extend the subject, don't repeat
- 40-90 characters
- Make it scannable

### Email Body
- Start with "Hi" or "Hey" (friendly, not corporate)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Use emoji for visual breaks
- One primary CTA
- Mobile-friendly (60% read on mobile)

### Send Times
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: 10 AM - 2 PM (best)
- **Avoid Monday**: Inbox overload
- **Avoid Friday PM**: Weekend mode
- **Test your audience**: Everyone's different

### Frequency
- Welcome series: Immediate, Day 3, Day 7
- Feature announcements: As released (max 1/week)
- Monthly newsletter: First Tuesday of month
- Re-engagement: 30 days, 60 days, then stop

### Metrics to Track
- Open rate (aim for >25%)
- Click rate (aim for >3%)
- Reply rate (higher = better engagement)
- Unsubscribe rate (under 0.5% is good)

**Remember:** These emails should feel like they're from a friend, not a corporation. Be helpful, not salesy. Respect the inbox.
